#  E-Commerce CLI Application

A modular, scalable **Command-Line Interface (CLI) E-Commerce System** built in Java ‚Äî designed to demonstrate **core software design patterns** such as Singleton, Factory, Strategy, Observer, Decorator, and Composite.  
This project simulates a real-world shopping experience.

##  Introduction

This CLI-based e-commerce system allows customers and admins to:

- Browse and manage products.
- Add products to a shopping cart.
- Checkout with multiple payment options.
- Track order status with real-time updates.
- View order history and order details.

The project emphasizes **clean code**, **design patterns**, and **production-like architecture** to simulate a real-world backend system.

##  Features

- **Product Catalog Management**  
  Add, view, and manage products via CLI.

- **Shopping Cart Operations**  
  Add, remove, and update products; calculate cart total.

- **Order Management**  
  Place orders and track status from payment to delivery.

- **Payment Processing**  
  Multiple payment strategies (Credit Card, PayPal).

- **Admin Mode**  
  View products, view all orders, and manage catalog.

- **Observer Pattern Integration**  
  Customers and admin receive real-time notifications on order status changes.

## üõ† Design Patterns Used

| Pattern         | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Singleton**   | Ensures a single instance of **DatabaseConnection**. |
| **Factory**     | Dynamically creates payment method instances. |
| **Strategy**    | Implements different payment methods under a common interface. |
| **Observer**    | Allows customers and admins to subscribe to order status changes. |
| **Decorator**   | Adds dynamic behaviors (Discounts, Tax, Gift Wrap) to products and orders. |
| **Composite**   | Handles product bundles as composite objects of products. |

##  Why This Project Stands Out

- Demonstrates **multiple real-world design patterns** clearly.
- Implements a **modular and maintainable architecture**.
- Uses the **Observer pattern** for real-time updates.
- Simulates realistic **e-commerce checkout flows**.
- Serves as a **miniature production-level project** for portfolio presentation.



##  Future Enhancements

- Integrate a real **SQL or NoSQL database**.
- Develop a **REST API version** using Spring Boot.
- Add **authentication and authorization**.
- Create a **web or GUI front-end**.
- Implement **WebSocket for live order tracking**.
- Add **Admin Product Management features** such as update and delete products.
