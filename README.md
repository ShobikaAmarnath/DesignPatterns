#  Design Patterns â€“ Java Implementations

This repository showcases **real-world Java implementations of multiple software design patterns** through two independent, production-style CLI applications:

-  **Smart Office â€“ Interactive Room Booking System**
-  **E-Commerce CLI Application**

Each project demonstrates practical, pattern-driven software architecture emphasizing **clean code, scalability, and maintainability** â€” ideal for academic, interview, and professional portfolio purposes.


##  Projects Overview

###  **E-Commerce CLI Application**
A modular command-line shopping system simulating a real e-commerce flow:
- Product catalog management (Add, View, Bundle)
- Shopping cart operations
- Checkout with multiple payment methods
- Real-time order status updates via Observer pattern
- Discounts, taxes, and add-ons using Decorator pattern

**Patterns Implemented:**
`Singleton`, `Factory`, `Strategy`, `Observer`, `Decorator`, `Composite`

###  **Smart Office â€“ Interactive Room Booking System**
A menu-driven smart office simulation managing:
- Room configurations and booking schedules  
- Occupancy detection via sensors  
- Automated AC and lighting systems  
- Auto-release of unoccupied rooms  

**Patterns Implemented:**
`Singleton`, `Command`, `Observer`, `Facade`, `Factory`, `Decorator (extension)`
